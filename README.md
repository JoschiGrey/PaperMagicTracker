# Paper Magic Tracker

This is a small Blazor Webassembly Application that seeks to give support in analyzing your gameplay. It is mostly intended for online webcam play in which 
you are already on a computer, but it could be used to track in person play as well.

## How it works

The main functionality is in tracking what cards are in which zone at a given time. Every card movement is logged and can be examined later.
This allows you to know how many and what cards are left in your library, while playing the game while also providing usefull statistics and probability calculations
and game time.

After the fact one can analyse the card movement that happened in game to give a overview on how many cards you drew, how long your commander lived or your available mana at
any given time.
